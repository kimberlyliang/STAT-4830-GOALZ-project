**Self-Critique for EEG Project Report**

**OBSERVE:**
Upon re-reading the report, the initial impression is that the problem statement is clear and well-connected to real-world applications, specifically in the context of sleep stage classification. This task is crucial for diagnosing sleep disorders, such as insomnia and sleep apnea, which affect millions globally. The ability to automate and optimize sleep stage detection from EEG data has potential applications in clinical diagnostics, wearable sleep trackers, and research into circadian rhythms. However, some technical sections lack precision, and the mathematical formulation needs refinement. Running the code highlighted performance issues related to memory usage and downsampling accuracy.

**ORIENT:**
- **Strengths:**
  - Clear problem statement with concrete real-world impact, particularly in the context of improving diagnostic tools for sleep disorders.
  - Detailed description of model selection and preprocessing steps, with specific relevance to capturing critical sleep features like spindles and K-complexes.
  - Transparent discussion of challenges and proposed solutions, especially regarding the Nyquist frequency and data processing constraints.

- **Areas for Improvement:**
  - Mathematical formulation needs more rigor and clarity; current equations lack sufficient detail on how features are derived from EEG signals.
  - Implementation details for MOIRA model require additional explanation, particularly around how masking strategies impact prediction accuracy.
  - Data handling techniques should be better documented, including the rationale for selected downsampling methods and how they preserve key sleep-related features.

- **Critical Risks/Assumptions:**
  - Assuming EEG dataset can be efficiently downsampled without losing critical features like sleep spindles and slow waves. Need to test downsampling strategy thoroughly.
  - Current project scope may be too ambitious given time and resource constraints. Need to simplify and focus on key tasks.

**DECIDE:**
- **Concrete Next Actions:**
  - Rewrite mathematical formulation with clearer notation and explanations, emphasizing the connection between EEG features and sleep stage predictions.
  - Expand MOIRA implementation section to cover key architectural components and their relevance to capturing sleep dynamics.
  - Add documentation for data processing pipeline and downsampling techniques, with specific attention to potential signal distortion of critical sleep features.
  - Lower the project scope to focus on getting a basic version working. This could include:
    - Treating downsampling as the primary problem and refining its implementation to ensure it doesn't obscure clinically relevant sleep patterns.
    - Working with data from just one patient to simplify data requirements and test model performance under controlled conditions.
    - Testing the MOIRA model on simpler or alternative datasets to validate its functionality before scaling up.
    - Clarifying the architecture and goals of the classification layer to ensure alignment with the core task of sleep stage classification.

**ACT:**
- **Resource Needs:**
  - Need to review time-series forecasting literature, especially MOIRA-related papers, to better understand its application to sleep EEG data.
  - Require additional computational resources to test different downsampling rates without sacrificing critical sleep information.
  - Plan to consult with peers experienced in PyTorch optimization for performance improvements.
  - Seek guidance from instructors on narrowing the scope while still meeting course objectives and ensuring the project remains valuable to the sleep research community.
