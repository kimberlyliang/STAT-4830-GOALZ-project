## Sleep Onset
Scoring arousals is based on "A Preliminary Report from the Sleep Disorders Atlas Task Force of the American Sleep Disorders Association" Sleep, vol. 15, no 2, 1992. (ASDA criteria).

The scoring of EEG arousals is independent from the scoring of sleep stages (i.e., an arousal can be scored in an epoch of recording which would be classified as wake by AASM criteria). An arousal can proceed to the wake stage (by AASM criteria) or can be followed by a return to sleep.

### Definition of Arousal:
An EEG arousal is an abrupt shift in EEG frequency, which may include alpha and/or theta waves and/or delta waves and/or frequencies greater than 16 Hz lasting at least 3 seconds and starting after at least 10 continuous seconds of sleep.

Artifacts, K complexes, and delta waves are included in meeting the 3-second duration criteria only when they occur within the EEG frequency shift (change in frequency must be visible before these waveforms). A "K" complex or spindle occurring immediately prior to the EEG shift or following is not included in the arousal duration.

Parts of the EEG totally obscured by EMG artifact are considered an arousal if the change in background EEG in addition to the area obscured by EMG is at least >3 sec.

### For Scoring Arousals:
- When unsure if change in background EEG represents an abrupt change, look at a 60-second window and note if there is a discrete change from background EEG.
- Note whether changes were evident on both EEG channels.
- Be careful to distinguish an increase in EEG frequency from EMG artifact (especially in delta sleep).
- Isolated bursts of delta activity or sawtooth-like waves do not constitute an arousal. In contrast, slow waves intermixed with fast activity that differs from background do qualify as arousals.
- Occasionally, EEG acceleration is superimposed on slower waves. If there is evidence of embedded EEG acceleration for >3 sec., mark as an arousal.

### Arousals in REM:
In stage REM, an EEG frequency shift must be accompanied by a simultaneous increase in amplitude of the chin EMG (lasting over 1.0 sec). An arousal starts when a definite change in background EEG is visualized. The increase in the chin EMG can occur anytime during the arousal (can be at the end) and is not a marker for the beginning of the arousal. However, increased EMG activity without a change in background EEG does not constitute an arousal.

#### Tips for Arousals in REM:
- If the level of REM EMG appears to be fluctuating, then the increase in EMG in the area of a putative arousal needs to be more than the background level of fluctuations, to identify this as a REM arousal.
- A long period of alpha activity before an EMG increase may mark the beginning of the arousal if the alpha activity represents the change in the background pattern.

### Potential Problems:
Some studies with high AHIs have many arousals that may appear to last >15 sec. within given epochs. If all such epochs were classified as AWAKE, then the respiratory events would not be included in the AHI and the AHI will be underestimated. When faced with this situation, the scorer may attempt to keep the duration of the arousal to as short as feasible (e.g., corresponding to the length of the waking EEG in that epoch). This will maximize the number of epochs containing arousals that are captured as "sleep."

## Rules for Assigning Sleep Stages when Arousal is Present in the Epoch
The following rules were established to maximize the amount of sleep identified and thus the number of respiratory events recorded:

- Brief arousals (<15 sec.) may require a change in sleep stage. The epoch is staged according to the sleep stage in the remaining parts of the epoch (not including the arousal). After an arousal, change to stage N1 until a K complex unassociated with an arousal or a sleep spindle occurs.
- If an arousal or an area of increased EMG causing artifact in the EEG channels is followed by Stage Wake (W), then the arousal is considered part of the record scored as a Stage Wake. If this part is >15 sec. long, then epoch is scored as a Stage Wake.
- In Deep Sleep (unequivocal Stage 3/4), when fast frequency waves are visualized as "riding" on the top of the delta waves, and there are no frequencies characteristic of Stage Wake:
  - If there is any reason to suspect that the fast frequencies are result of artifact (like a sudden increase in EMG bleeding into EEG), an arousal is not scored.
  - When the fast frequencies are not the result of artifact, an arousal is scored. Deep Sleep is scored when delta waves persist despite the faster frequencies riding on top, independent of the length of the arousal.
- **Note for Delta Sleep:** When an arousal includes bursts of delta waves, these waves are not used for meeting Deep Sleep criteria (e.g., Deep Sleep is scored only if there is >20% of the epoch covered by delta waves outside of the arousal).

## Rules for Assigning Sleep Stages
### EEG Frequencies
EEG frequencies are divided into the following bandwidths:
- **Beta (β):** > 13 Hz
- **Alpha (α):** 8-13 Hz
- **Theta (θ):** 4-8 Hz
- **Delta (δ):** < 4 Hz

### Alpha Rhythm Characteristics:
- Seen in the relaxed waking state with the eyes closed.
- Attenuates with eye opening, anxiety, or mental activity such as calculations.
- Slows in drowsiness and disappears in sleep.
- Generated by occipital lobes with broad reflection to temporal and mastoid areas.

### Stage W - Waking State
#### Rules:
- Score epochs as stage W when more than 50% of the epoch has alpha rhythm over the occipital region.
- Score epochs without visually discernible alpha rhythm as stage W if any of the following are present:
  1. Eye blinks at a frequency of 0.5-2 Hz
  2. Reading eye movements
  3. Irregular conjugate rapid eye movements associated with normal or high chin muscle tone.

## 6.2.2 Sleep Onset
Sleep onset is defined by the start of the first epoch scored as any stage other than stage W.

- Brief arousals (<15 sec.) may require a change in sleep stage. The epoch is staged according to the sleep stage in the remaining parts of the epoch (not including the arousal). After an arousal, change to stage N1 until a K complex unassociated with an arousal or a sleep spindle occurs.

## Rules for Assigning Sleep Stages
### Stage 1 Sleep (N1)
Stage N1 occurs during the transition from wakefulness to other sleep stages. It is characterized by:
- A background of relatively low voltage, mixed frequency EEG activity.
- Noticeable activity in the 2-7 Hz range with no clearly defined K complexes or sleep spindles in the first half of the epoch.
- Slow eye movements, typically most prominent during early portions of the stage.
- The tonic EMG level may be lower than observed during relaxed wakefulness.

#### Rules:
- In subjects who generate alpha rhythm, score stage N1 if alpha rhythm is attenuated and replaced by low amplitude, mixed frequency activity for more than 50% of the epoch.
- In subjects who do not generate alpha rhythm, score stage N1 commencing with the earliest of any of the following:
  1. Activity in the range of 4-7 Hz with slowing of background frequencies by ≥1 Hz from those of stage W.
  2. Vertex sharp waves.
  3. Slow eye movements.

### Stage 2 Sleep (N2)
Stage N2 is defined by:
- A background similar to Stage N1 sleep with the presence of K complexes and/or sleep spindles.
- It is impossible to define the difference between Stage N1 and Stage N2 based solely on background activity.
- Bursts of other polymorphic high voltage slow waves that do not have the precise morphology of a K complex are also frequently seen.

#### Rules:
- Score Stage N2 if one or both of the following occur during the first half of the epoch or the last half of the previous epoch:
  1. One or more K complexes unassociated with arousals.
  2. One or more trains of sleep spindles.
- Continue to score epochs with low amplitude, mixed frequency EEG activity without K complexes or sleep spindles as Stage N2 if they are preceded by K complexes unassociated with arousals or sleep spindles.
- End Stage N2 sleep when one of the following events occurs:
  1. Transition to Stage W.
  2. An arousal occurs followed by low amplitude, mixed frequency EEG and slow eye movements (score as Stage N1).
  3. Transition to Stage N3 or Stage R.

### Deep Sleep (N3)
No attempt is made to distinguish Stage 3 from Stage 4; they are combined into a single category: Deep Sleep (N3).

#### Characteristics:
- Deep Sleep is scored when 20% or more of the epoch consists of delta waves (<2 Hz) with an amplitude greater than 75 μV.
- The 20% criteria refers to the time occupied by high amplitude, slow waves and does not include intervening higher frequency, lower amplitude waves or K complexes.
- To fulfill the criteria for Deep Sleep, at least 5-6 high voltage delta waves must be found in a 30-second epoch.
- Delta waves embedded in increased frequency activity (arousals) do not contribute to the calculation of time in delta sleep.

#### Additional Considerations:
- Sleep spindles and K complexes may or may not be present in Deep Sleep.
- Eye movements do not occur in Deep Sleep, though the EOG may reflect high voltage slow wave activity.
- EMG remains tonically active, but levels may reach very low levels indistinguishable from REM sleep.

### Stage REM Sleep (R)
Stage REM is defined by:
- A background of relatively low voltage, mixed frequency EEG with accompanying episodes of rapid eye movements (REMs).
- EEG resembles Stage N1, except vertex sharp waves are less prominent.
- Characteristic "sawtooth" waves appear as notched waves in the theta range.
- Alpha activity is slightly slower (by 1-2 Hz) than wakeful alpha rhythm.
- EMG levels reach their lowest points but may show phasic twitches and intermittent bursts of activity.

#### Start of Stage REM:
- Stage REM begins when K complexes, sleep spindles, and delta waves cease.
- If EMG levels drop before the last sleep spindle, K complex, or delta wave, then REM is scored from that point.
- If EMG levels drop after these events, REM is scored from the EMG drop.

#### Transition and Termination:
- Score Stage REM when EEG pattern characteristic of REM appears, even if EMG is elevated due to snoring artifacts.
- Stage REM ends when:
  1. K complexes or sleep spindles appear without associated REMs.
  2. Transition occurs to Stage Wake.
  3. Sustained EMG increases are observed.

### Wake-REM Transition:
- If an epoch of wake precedes REM and shows a low voltage mixed EEG pattern, score as Stage N1 until EMG drops, then Stage REM.
- If Stage Wake interrupts REM (>15 sec.), scoring depends on the EEG background:
  - Score as Stage N1 if EMG is elevated.
  - Score as Stage REM if EMG is at REM levels.

#### Arousals in REM:
- If an arousal occurs in REM, sleep stage remains REM unless EMG increases after the arousal, in which case the next epoch is non-REM.
- K complexes seen after arousals in REM do not necessarily change the state unless intervening wake periods are observed.

### End of Stage REM:
- REM is scored until:
  - K complexes or sleep spindles appear in absence of REMs.
  - Transition to Stage Wake occurs.
  - EMG levels rise persistently.
- Isolated K complexes do not change REM unless no eye movements or sawtooth waves follow within 3 minutes.

## 6.2.7 Special Considerations for Sleep Scoring

### Scoring REM in Presence of Muscle Artifacts:
- Identification of REM may be challenging when EMG bursts coincide with REM.
- If EEG pattern remains consistent with REM, REM is scored regardless of EMG elevation.
- If EMG artifacts are snoring-related, they can be ignored if intervening EMG remains low.

### Medications and Sleep Scoring:
- Certain medications (benzodiazepines, barbiturates) may alter sleep architecture, especially spindles and REM.
- Beta activity may mimic spindles; these typically exceed 13 Hz and are longer in duration.
- Review previous epochs to ensure appropriate scoring of sleep spindles versus drug-induced patterns.
