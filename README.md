# Optimizing EEG-Based Deep Learning Models for N1 Sleep Onset Detection

 Sleep onset detection, particularly the accurate identification of N1 sleep (the first stage of non-REM sleep), plays a critical role in sleep disorder diagnosis and clinical evaluation. Yet, it remains one of the most elusive stages for both manual and automated systems to classify due to its transitional nature. N1 represents a fleeting phase, occupying only about 5\% of sleep and exhibiting significant overlap in features with both wakefulness and deeper sleep stages. In this project, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework, combining convolutional and transformer-based modules specifically tailored to enhance N1 classification accuracy from single-channel EEG recordings.
